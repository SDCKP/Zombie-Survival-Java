Zombie Survival Java
====================

A Java-based 2d survival zombie game

This is a game created during my Java learning period, back in early 2014

It uses the Swing graphic library so it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.

The project is made on NetBeans, to run the project just download the repository, import the project and run it.

A pre-compiled jar is available on the dist folder and can be executed with the command:

*java -jar dist/Zombies.jar*

About the Game
--------------

Gameplay video available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VJW0JWPKQc

The game instructions can be found inside the game menu.

The physics and collisions are made from scratch so there might be some errors

The game is expandable by design, so new items and functionalities can be added easily

This is a public domain project, although it is more suitable for learning purposes
